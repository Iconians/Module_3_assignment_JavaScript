#Build these projects out and submit them

**Utility Library (Node.js)**
Build a utility library with 5 useful functions in Node.js:
- Create `utils.js` with functions like: capitalize, reverse string, random number generator, etc.
- Create `test.js` that uses and tests all functions
- Export functions using `module.exports`
- Run with `node test.js`

**Rock Paper Scissors (Terminal)**
Build a Rock Paper Scissors game:
- Player chooses rock, paper, or scissors
- Computer makes random choice
- Determine winner
- Track wins/losses
- Use readline for input
- Run with `node rps.js`

**Requirements**
- At least 5 functions in `utils.js`, each doing one clear task. All exported via `module.exports`. `test.js` imports and calls each function and shows output. Use only concepts from Modules 1–3 (variables, control flow, functions, require/module.exports).
- Game uses functions for logic (e.g., get computer choice, determine winner). Uses readline for input. Correct win/loss/tie rules. Optional: loop for multiple rounds and track wins/losses. No concepts beyond Module 3.

**Submission**
Submit repos.
